# Project Brief: Homogenaize Library

## Overview
A TypeScript-native library designed to work seamlessly in both browser and backend environments, providing [specific functionality to be defined based on further requirements].

## Core Requirements

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript (native)
- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Schema Validation**: Zod v4.x (strict requirement)
- **Target Environments**: 
  - Browser (all modern browsers)
  - Backend (Node.js/Bun compatible)

### Development Standards
- Full TypeScript type safety
- Runtime schema validation using Zod v4
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Cross-environment compatibility
- Tree-shakeable exports for optimal bundle sizes

## Architecture Principles
- **Isomorphic Design**: Code should run identically in browser and server environments
- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript's type system with Zod runtime validation
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead, efficient bundling
- **Developer Experience**: Clear APIs, excellent documentation, helpful error messages

## Build Configuration
- Vite for development server and bundling
- Bun for package management and test running
- Separate builds for:
  - ESM (primary)
  - CommonJS (compatibility)
  - Browser UMD (if needed)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests using Bun's built-in test runner
- Integration tests for cross-environment compatibility
- Type testing to ensure API contracts
- Performance benchmarks

```

## Development Workflow
1. Bun for dependency management
2. Vite for development with HMR
3. TypeScript strict mode enabled
4. Zod schemas co-located with implementations
5. Automated testing on commits
6. Semantic versioning

## API Design Considerations
- Intuitive, chainable APIs where appropriate
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Strong typing with helpful generics

## Questions for Clarification
To complete this project brief, please provide details on:

1. **Primary Purpose**: What specific problem will this library solve?
2. **Core Features**: What are the main functionalities you envision?
3. **Target Audience**: Who are your colleagues and what are their use cases?
4. **Similar Libraries**: Are there existing solutions you're drawing inspiration from?
5. **Performance Requirements**: Any specific performance benchmarks or constraints?
6. **API Style Preference**: Functional, object-oriented, or mixed approach?
7. **Release Timeline**: When do you need the first version ready?

## Next Steps
Once the above questions are answered, we can:
1. Define specific modules and their responsibilities
2. Create detailed API specifications
3. Set up the initial project structure
4. Implement core functionality with tests
