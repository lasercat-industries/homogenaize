# Project Brief: Homogenaize Library

## Overview
A TypeScript-native library that provides a unified, type-safe interface for interacting with major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini). The key differentiator is first-class support for structured outputs and forced tool calls, addressing critical limitations in existing LLM libraries.

## Core Requirements

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript (native)
- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Schema Validation**: Zod v4.x (strict requirement)
- **Target Environments**: 
  - Browser (all modern browsers)
  - Backend (Node.js/Bun compatible)

### Development Standards
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) - tests must be written before implementation
- Full TypeScript type safety
- Runtime schema validation using Zod v4
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Cross-environment compatibility
- Tree-shakeable exports for optimal bundle sizes

## Architecture Principles
- **Isomorphic Design**: Code should run identically in browser and server environments
- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript's type system with Zod runtime validation
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead, efficient bundling
- **Developer Experience**: Clear APIs, excellent documentation, helpful error messages

## Build Configuration
- Vite for development server and bundling
- Bun for package management and test running
- Separate builds for:
  - ESM (primary)
  - CommonJS (compatibility)
  - Browser UMD (if needed)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests using Bun's built-in test runner
- Integration tests for cross-environment compatibility
- Type testing to ensure API contracts
- Performance benchmarks

```

## Development Workflow
1. Bun for dependency management
2. Vite for development with HMR
3. TypeScript strict mode enabled
4. Zod schemas co-located with implementations
5. Automated testing on commits
6. Semantic versioning

## API Design Considerations
- Intuitive, chainable APIs where appropriate
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Strong typing with helpful generics

## Core Features

1. **Unified API**: Single interface for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini
2. **Structured Outputs**: First-class support with Zod schema validation
3. **Forced Tool Calls**: Require LLMs to use specific tools when needed
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with automatic type inference
5. **Streaming Support**: Handle streaming responses with partial validation
6. **Provider Transparency**: Access provider-specific features when needed

## Target Audience
TypeScript developers building LLM-powered applications who need:
- Reliable structured outputs from LLMs
- The ability to force tool usage
- Type-safe responses without manual validation
- Easy switching between LLM providers

## API Design Philosophy
- **Builder Pattern**: Fluent API for configuration
- **Schema-First**: Define expected output structure upfront
- **Async/Await**: Modern promise-based interface
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Simple defaults with powerful options

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Core Provider Interface**: Abstract base for all LLM providers
2. **Schema Validation System**: Zod integration for type-safe outputs
3. **OpenAI Provider**: First implementation with structured outputs
4. **Tool System**: Define and execute tools with forced usage
5. **Anthropic & Gemini Providers**: Expand provider support
6. **Streaming Support**: Handle partial responses with validation

## Success Criteria
- Seamless provider switching with identical APIs
- 100% type safety for structured outputs
- Reliable tool usage enforcement across providers
- Minimal performance overhead vs direct SDKs
- Excellent developer experience with clear documentation
