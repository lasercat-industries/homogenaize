# Implement List Models Functionality

## Task Definition

Add functionality to retrieve available models from each provider's API. This will allow users to discover what models are available for use with each provider.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Add ModelInfo interface to provider types

- Create interface for model information with id, name, description, capabilities, etc.
- Add listModels method to Provider interface

### 2. Implement listModels in BaseProvider

- Add abstract method that each provider must implement

### 3. Implement for OpenAI provider

- Call GET /v1/models endpoint
- Transform response to ModelInfo format
- Handle authentication with headers

### 4. Implement for Anthropic provider

- Call GET /v1/models endpoint
- Transform response to ModelInfo format
- Handle authentication with headers

### 5. Implement for Gemini provider

- Call GET /v1beta/models endpoint
- Transform response to ModelInfo format
- Handle authentication with headers (x-goog-api-key)

### 6. Add listModels to LLMClient

- Expose method on client interface
- Implement in LLMClientImpl to delegate to provider

### 7. Add tests

- Unit tests with mocked responses for each provider
- Integration tests with real API calls (when API keys available)
