# Task: Update project structure to colocate tests

## Task definition

Update the project structure in projectbrief.md to reflect that tests should be colocated with their implementation files rather than in a separate tests directory.

## Implementation plan

1. Read the current projectbrief.md
2. Update the project structure section to show tests next to implementation files
3. Ensure the new structure follows common patterns for colocated tests (e.g., _.test.ts, _.spec.ts)

## Update log

- 2025-01-10 15:10: Task started. Created CSV entry and spec file.
- 2025-01-10 15:12: Task completed. Updated project structure to show tests colocated with implementation files using \*.test.ts pattern. Also added specs/ directory to the structure.
