# Add Comprehensive Logging to All Providers and Code Paths

**Task ID**: C36E380B-D09D-4578-807F-A0C1185F57E0  
**Created**: 2025-01-10 17:00  
**Status**: done

## Task Definition

Add comprehensive Winston logging throughout the entire codebase, ensuring all providers, code paths, and operations have appropriate logging at the right levels. This builds on the existing Winston logging infrastructure already implemented.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Anthropic Provider**
   - Add logging for all API calls
   - Log request/response details (with sanitization)
   - Log errors and retries
   - Log streaming events

2. **Gemini Provider**
   - Add logging for all API calls
   - Log request/response details
   - Log errors and retries
   - Log streaming events

3. **Retry Logic**
   - Log retry attempts
   - Log backoff calculations
   - Log retry decisions
   - Log final outcomes

4. **Client.ts**
   - Log client creation
   - Log method calls
   - Log configuration changes

5. **Streaming**
   - Log stream start/end
   - Log chunk processing
   - Log stream errors

6. **Tool Execution**
   - Log tool definitions
   - Log tool calls
   - Log execution results
   - Log execution errors

7. **Schema Conversion**
   - Log Zod to JSON Schema conversion
   - Log schema validation
   - Log conversion errors

8. **Generic Client**
   - Log provider selection
   - Log lazy initialization

## Logging Levels

- **error**: API failures, critical errors
- **warn**: Retries, fallbacks, deprecations
- **info**: API calls, major operations
- **debug**: Request/response details, internal state
- **verbose**: Detailed tracing, all data

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All providers have consistent logging
- [ ] Sensitive data is automatically sanitized
- [ ] Logging is silent by default
- [ ] Log levels are appropriate for each operation
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
- [ ] All code paths have logging coverage

## Update Log

**2025-01-10 17:00** - Task created, starting implementation
**2025-01-10 17:30** - Task completed. Added comprehensive logging to:

- OpenAI provider (API calls, tool execution, schema conversion)
- Anthropic provider (API calls, tool execution, response processing)
- Gemini provider (API calls, tool execution, response processing)
- Retry logic (attempts, backoff, decisions)
- Streaming handlers (chunk processing, validation)
- Schema conversion (Zod to JSON Schema)
- Tool execution across all providers
