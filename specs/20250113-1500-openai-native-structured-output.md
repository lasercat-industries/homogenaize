# Implement Native Structured Output for OpenAI

**Task ID**: EFE45FED-8C6F-4D07-98E8-F81A6EC2F7A0  
**Created**: 2025-01-13 15:00  
**Status**: inprogress

## Task Definition

Implement native structured output support for OpenAI using the `response_format` field with `json_schema` type. Remove the tool-based workaround and leverage OpenAI's ability to use both `response_format` and `tools` simultaneously.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Update transformRequest in OpenAI provider**
   - When schema is provided, use `response_format` with `json_schema`
   - Remove tool-based structured output workaround
   - Allow both `response_format` and `tools` to coexist

2. **Update transformResponse in OpenAI provider**
   - Handle structured JSON from message content
   - Parse and validate against the schema
   - Continue handling tool calls normally

3. **Update tests**
   - Fix OpenAI provider tests to expect `response_format`
   - Update integration tests
   - Verify both schema-only and schema+tools scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Native structured output works when schema is provided
- [ ] Tools and structured output can be used together
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Tool-based workaround is removed
- [ ] Response parsing and validation works correctly
