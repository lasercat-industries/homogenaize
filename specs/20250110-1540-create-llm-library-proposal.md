# Task: Create unified LLM library proposal

## Task definition
Design and document a TypeScript library that provides unified, type-safe access to major LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini) with strong support for structured input/output and forced tool calls.

## Implementation plan
1. Analyze the openai-api-usage-analysis.md file to understand current usage patterns
2. Research how each provider handles structured output and forced tool calls
3. Design a unified API that abstracts provider differences
4. Create a comprehensive proposal document
5. Update projectbrief.md with specific library details
