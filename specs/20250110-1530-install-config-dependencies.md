# Task: Install dependencies for config files

## Task definition
Check newly added configuration files (linting, testing, TypeScript) and install all required dependencies to ensure they work properly.

## Implementation plan
1. List all new config files to understand what tools are being configured
2. Check each config file to identify required dependencies
3. Install missing dependencies
4. Verify all configs work with their respective tools
