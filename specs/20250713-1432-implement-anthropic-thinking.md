# Implement Anthropic Thinking Tokens Feature

## Task Definition

Implement support for Anthropic's thinking tokens feature, which allows Claude to show its reasoning process before generating a response. This includes adding the `thinking` parameter to requests and handling thinking content in responses.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Research Anthropic Thinking Feature

- [x] Review Anthropic API documentation for thinking tokens
- [x] Understand request parameters (thinking, maxThinkingTokens)
- [x] Understand response structure with thinking content

### 2. Update Anthropic Provider Implementation

- [x] Add thinking parameter to request transformation
- [x] Add maxThinkingTokens parameter handling
- [x] Handle thinking content in response transformation
- [x] Update type definitions if needed

### 3. Add Tests

- [x] Write unit tests for thinking token feature
- [x] Test with and without thinking enabled
- [x] Test maxThinkingTokens parameter
- [x] Update integration tests

### 4. Verify Implementation

- [x] Run all tests
- [x] Run typecheck
- [x] Update documentation if needed

## Technical Details

- The thinking feature is already defined in types but not implemented
- Need to map provider-specific features correctly in the request
- Handle thinking content in the response appropriately
