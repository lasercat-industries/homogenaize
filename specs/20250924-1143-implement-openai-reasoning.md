# Implement OpenAI Reasoning Effort Feature

## Task Definition

Add support for OpenAI's reasoning_effort parameter that allows configuring the level of reasoning (minimal, low, medium, high) for models. This feature works with any OpenAI model through the existing chat completions endpoint.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Add reasoning types to provider interfaces**
   - Add reasoningEffort to OpenAIChatRequest features type
   - Support 'minimal' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' values

2. **Update OpenAI provider implementation**
   - Add reasoning_effort to OpenAIRequest interface
   - Handle reasoningEffort in transformRequest method
   - Add reasoning_tokens to Usage interface and response handling

3. **Write tests for the feature**
   - Test request transformation with reasoning effort
   - Test response handling with reasoning tokens
   - Test with different effort levels
