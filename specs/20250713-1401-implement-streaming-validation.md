# Implement Streaming with Partial Validation

## Task Definition

Implement streaming support with partial validation for all providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini). This allows users to receive and validate structured output incrementally as it streams from the LLM.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Design Streaming Interface

- [x] Define streaming types and interfaces
- [x] Create partial validation strategy
- [ ] Design error handling for stream interruptions

### 2. Implement Base Streaming Logic

- [x] Create streaming response handler
- [x] Build partial JSON parser
- [x] Implement incremental Zod validation

### 3. Provider-Specific Implementations

- [ ] OpenAI streaming with structured outputs
- [ ] Anthropic streaming with structured outputs
- [ ] Gemini streaming with structured outputs

### 4. Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for partial validation
- [ ] Integration tests for each provider
- [ ] Error scenario tests

## Technical Considerations

- Must handle incomplete JSON gracefully
- Validation should work on partial objects
- Stream interruptions should be recoverable
- Type safety must be maintained throughout

## Dependencies

- Requires completed provider implementations
- Needs schema validation system
