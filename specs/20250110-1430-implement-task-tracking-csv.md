# Task: Implement task tracking CSV system

## Task definition
Create a CSV file system for tracking development tasks with the following requirements:
- CSV file location: memory-bank/tasktracking.csv
- Required columns: id (UUID), name, status (active/inprogress/done/wontdo), dependson, spec
- Each task should have a corresponding spec file in the specs/ directory

2. Add initial tasks to demonstrate the system
3. Establish format for spec files with required sections
4. Document the process for future task management
