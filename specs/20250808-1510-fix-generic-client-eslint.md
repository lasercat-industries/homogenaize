# Fix ESLint Errors in generic-client.ts

**Task ID**: C8F9G0A1-2C3D-4E5F-6G78-9H0I1J2K3L4M  
**Created**: 2025-08-08 15:10  
**Status**: done

## Task Definition

Fix ESLint errors in the generic-client.ts file that were introduced during the implementation of the generic API. The errors were related to missing imports for TypeScript types.

## Implementation Plan

1. Identify missing imports from ESLint error output
2. Add necessary type imports to generic-client.ts
3. Fix type casting issues if any arise
4. Verify both typecheck and lint pass

## Errors Fixed

### Missing Imports

- Added import for `TypedProvider` type from './providers/types'
- Added import for `ProviderName` type from './providers/types'
- Added import for `ProviderChatRequest` type from './providers/types'

### Type Casting Issues

- Fixed type conversion errors by using `unknown` as intermediate type
- Updated lines 168 and 206 to use `as unknown as ProviderChatRequest<ProviderName, T>`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All ESLint errors resolved
- [x] TypeScript type checking passes
- [x] No new errors introduced
- [x] Tests continue to pass
