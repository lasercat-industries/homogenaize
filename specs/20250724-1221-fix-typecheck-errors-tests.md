# Fix TypeScript Type Errors in Test Files

## Task Definition

Fix 6 TypeScript type errors that are occurring in test files across the codebase:

1. `src/integration/gemini-client.test.ts:60` - '"STOP"' is not assignable to finishReason type
2. `src/integration/real-api.test.ts:312` - '"tool_use"' is not assignable to finishReason type
3. `src/providers/anthropic/anthropic.test.ts:159` - Object is not assignable to string
4. `src/providers/gemini/gemini.test.ts:85` - '"STOP"' is not assignable to finishReason type
5. `src/providers/gemini/gemini.test.ts:183` - Object is not assignable to string
6. `src/providers/openai/openai.test.ts:154` - Object is not assignable to string

## Implementation Plan

1. Review the correct finishReason type definition in `src/providers/provider.ts`
2. Fix finishReason errors by using correct lowercase values ('stop' instead of 'STOP', 'tool_calls' instead of 'tool_use')
3. Fix Object not assignable to string errors by examining the expected types and correcting test assertions
4. Run tests after each fix to ensure no regressions

## Update Log

### 2025-07-24 12:21

- Created task to fix TypeScript type errors in test files
- Identified that finishReason type is defined as `'stop' | 'length' | 'tool_calls' | 'content_filter'`
- Starting with first error in gemini-client.test.ts

### 2025-07-24 12:35

- Fixed all 6 TypeScript type errors:
  1. Changed 'STOP' to 'stop' in gemini-client.test.ts
  2. Changed 'tool_use' to 'tool_calls' in real-api.test.ts
  3. Added generic type parameter to anthropic.test.ts for structured output
  4. Changed 'STOP' to 'stop' and added generic type parameter in gemini.test.ts
  5. Added generic type parameter to openai.test.ts for structured output
- All typecheck errors resolved, but some tests are now failing due to the changes
- The generic type parameters were needed to satisfy TypeScript but caused the tests to expect different behavior
